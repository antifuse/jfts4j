## What it does
jfts4j is a converter for Turing Machine simulations. It supports conversion between JFLAP XML format, Turing Machine Simulator script text and FLACI JSON. 
The GUI is designed with JavaFX.

## What not to do
**Do not** try to convert non-Turing (or multi-tape) JFLAP automata. Keep Turing Machine Simulator scripts in their standard format, leaving out comments and sticking to the order name-init-accept.
If the program does nothing and you are absolutely sure it should not, message me on here (slow) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/antifuse) (fast).
